# pic32mx470-rs-hello-world
Hello World program in Rust for PIC32MX470

Can be compiled with a nightly Rust toolchain. Requires [`pic-32-tools`] or the
Microchip xc32 toolchain to generate the hex file to be flashed and to rebuild
`libnative.a`.

[`pic-32-tools`]: https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT-compiler-builds/releases

Please note that this is very experimental.
